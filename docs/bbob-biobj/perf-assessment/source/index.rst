Welcome to the experimental setup description for the bbob-biobj suite!
=======================================================================

This document details the specificities of Coco's performance assessment with respect to the biobjective test suite
``bbob-biobj``.


Will go here:

* Set-indicator value replaces objective function (Tobias)

  - Evaluation based on the complete archive of nondominated solutions, independent of population size (Tobias)

  - explain - give formula for the computation of the hypervolume (if there are no points dominating the Nadir)

* Choice of the targets based on best estimation of Pareto front (using all the data we have) - chosen instance wise

* we record for 10 instances but display result for only 5 where we have a good estimation of the Pareto front (Dimo)
