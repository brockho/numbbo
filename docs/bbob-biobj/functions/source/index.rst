The ``bbob-biobj`` test suite contains 55 bi-objective functions in continuous domain which are derived from combining
functions of the well-known single-objective noiseless ``bbob`` test suite. It will be used as the main test suite of
the upcoming `BBOB-2016 workshop <http://numbbo.github.io/workshops/BBOB-2016/>`_ at GECCO. Besides giving the actual
function definitions and presenting their (known) properties, this documentation also aims at
giving the rational behind our approach in terms of function groups, instances, and potential objective space
normalization.

Introduction
============

In the following, we consider bi-objective, unconstrained **minimization**
problems of the form

.. math::
  \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x)=(f_\alpha(x),f_\beta(x))

with :math:`n` being the number of variables of the problem (also called
the problem dimension), :math:`f_\alpha: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`
and :math:`f_\beta: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}` being the two unconstrained
objective functions, and the :math:`\min` operator related to the
standard *dominance relation*. A solution :math:`x\in\mathbb{R}^n`
is thereby said to *dominate* another solution :math:`y\in\mathbb{R}^n` if
:math:`f_\alpha(x) \leq f_\alpha(y)` and :math:`f_\beta(x) \leq f_\beta(y)` hold and at
least one of the inequalities is strict.

Solutions which are not dominated by any other solution in the search
space are called *Pareto-optimal* or *efficient solutions*. All
Pareto-optimal solutions constitute the *Pareto set* of which an 
approximation is sought. The Pareto set's image in the
objective space :math:`f(\mathbb{R}^n)` is called *Pareto front*.

.. The *ideal point* is defined as the vector (in objective space) 
.. containing the optimal function values of the (two) objective functions.


Definitions and Terminology
---------------------------
We remind in this section different definitions.

*function, instance*
 A function within COCO is a parametrized function :math:`f_\theta:
 \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m` with :math:`\theta \in \Theta` a set of
 parameters. A parameter determines a so-called instance. For example,
 :math:`\theta` encodes the location of the optimum and two different
 instances have shifted optima.
 
 The integer :math:`n` is the dimension of the search space and
 :math:`m=2` for the  ``bbob-biobj`` test suite. 

*ideal point*
 The ideal point is defined as the vector (in objective space)
 containing the optimal function values of the (two) objective
 functions. More precisely let :math:`f_\alpha^{\rm opt}:= \inf_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n} f_\alpha(x)` and
 :math:`f_\beta^{\rm opt}:= \sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n} f_\beta(x)`, the ideal point is given by
 
 .. math::
    :nowrap:

	\begin{equation*}
	z_{\rm ideal}  =  (f_\alpha^{\rm opt},f_\beta^{\rm opt})
    \end{equation*}
    

 
*nadir point* 
 The *nadir point* (in objective space) consists in each objective of
 the worst value obtained by a Pareto-optimal solution. More precisely
 let :math:`\mathcal{PO}` be the set of Pareto optimal points then the nadir point satisfies
 
 .. math::
    :nowrap:

	\begin{equation*}
	z_{\rm nadir}  =   \left( \sup_{x \in \mathcal{PO}} f_\alpha(x),
     \sup_{x \in \mathcal{PO}} f_\beta(x)  \right)
    \end{equation*} 
    
 In the case of two objectives with unicity of the global minimum of each objective (that
 is a single point in the search space maps to the global minimum) then 
    
 .. math::
    :nowrap:

	\begin{equation*}
	z_{\rm nadir}  =   \left( f_\alpha(x_{\rm opt,\beta}),
      f_\beta(x_{\rm opt,\alpha})  \right)
    \end{equation*} 
    
   
 where :math:`x_{\rm opt,\alpha}= \arg \min f_\alpha(x)` and 
 :math:`x_{\rm opt,\beta}= \arg \min f_\beta(x)`.



Overview of the Proposed ``bbob-biobj`` Test Suite
==================================================

The ``bbob-biobj`` test suite provides 55 bi-objective functions in six
dimensions (2, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 40) with arbitrary many instances (10 of them being typically fixed for a BBOB workshop).
The 55 functions are derived from combining a subset of the 24 well-known
single-objective functions of the ``bbob`` test suite which
has been used since 2009 in the `BBOB workshop series
<http://numbbo.github.io/workshops/>`_ . While concrete details on each of
the 55 ``bbob-biobj`` functions will be given in
:ref:`sec-test-functions`, we will detail here the main rationals behind
them together with their common properties.


The Single-objective ``bbob`` Functions Used
--------------------------------------------
The ``bbob-biobj`` test suite is designed to be able to assess  performance of algorithms with respect to well-identified difficulties in optimization typically  occurring in real-world problems. A multi-objective problem being a combination of single-objective problems, one can obtain multi-objective problems with representative difficulties by simply combining single objective functions with representative difficulties observed in real-world problems. For this purpose we naturally use the single-objective ``bbob`` suite.

Combining all 24 ``bbob`` functions in pairs thereby results in
:math:`24^2=576` bi-objective functions overall. We however assume that multi-objective optimization algorithms are invariant or not very sensitive to permutations of the objective functions such that combining the 24  ``bbob`` functions and taking out the function :math:`(g_2,g_1)` if the function :math:`(g_1,g_2)` is present results in :math:`24+ {24 \choose 2} = 300` functions [#]_.

.. Given that most (if not all) multi-objective optimization algorithms are
.. invariant to permutations of the objective functions, a bi-objective
.. function combining for example the sphere function as the first
.. objective with the Rastrigin function as the second objective will
.. result in the same performance than if the Rastrigin function is the
.. first and the sphere function is the second objective function. 
.. Hence, we should keep only one of the resulting
.. bi-objective functions. Combining then all 24 ``bbob`` functions

.. [#] The first objective is chosen as ``bbob`` function *i*
  and the second as ``bbob`` function *j* with *i* :math:`\leq` *j*,
  results in :math:`24+ {24 \choose 2} = 300` functions.

Some first tests, e.g. in [BTH2015a]_, showed that having 300 functions
in Coco's first bi-objective suite is impracticable in terms
of the overall running time of the benchmarking experiment.  We then decided to exploit the organization of the ``bbob`` functions into classes to choose a subset of functions. More precisely the 24 original ``bbob`` functions are grouped into five function
classes where each class gathers functions with similar properties, namely

  1. separable functions
  2. functions with low or moderate conditioning
  3. functions with high conditioning and unimodal
  4. multi-modal functions with adequate global structure, 
  5. multi-modal functions with weak global structure.



To create the ``bbob-biobj`` suite, we choose two functions within each class. This way we do not introduce any bias towards a specific class. In addition within each class, the functions are chosen to be the most
representative without repeating similar functions. For example,
only one Ellipsoid, one Rastrigin, and one Gallagher function are
included in the ``bbob-biobj`` suite although they appear in
separate versions in the ``bbob`` suite. Finally our choice of  10 ``bbob`` functions for creating the ``bbob-biobj`` test suite is the following:

.. We chose two functions within each class
..  consider only the following 10 of the 24 ``bbob``
.. functions:


.. The above ten ``bbob`` functions have been chosen for the creation
.. of the ``bbob-biobj`` suite in a way to not introduce any bias
.. towards a specific class
.. by choosing exactly two functions per ``bbob`` function class.
.. Within each class, the functions were chosen to be the most
.. representative without repeating similar functions. For example,
.. only one Ellipsoid, one Rastrigin, and one Gallagher function are
.. included in the ``bbob-biobj`` suite although they appear in
.. separate versions in the ``bbob`` suite.


* Separable functions

  - Sphere (function 1 in ``bbob`` suite)
  - Ellipsoid separable (function 2 in ``bbob`` suite)

* Functions with low or moderate conditioning 

  - Attractive sector (function 6 in ``bbob`` suite)
  - Rosenbrock original (function 8 in ``bbob`` suite)

* Functions with high conditioning and unimodal 

  - Sharp ridge (function 13 in ``bbob`` suite)
  - Sum of different powers (function 14 in ``bbob`` suite)

* Multi-modal functions with adequate global structure 

  - Rastrigin (function 15 in ``bbob`` suite)
  - Schaffer F7, condition 10 (function 17 in ``bbob`` suite)

* Multi-modal functions with weak global structure 

  - Schwefel x*sin(x) (function 20 in ``bbob`` suite)
  - Gallagher 101 peaks (function 21 in ``bbob`` suite)

  
Using the above described pairwise combinations, this results in
having :math:`10+{10 \choose 2} = 55` bi-objective functions in
the final `bbob-biobj` suite. Those functions are denoted :math:`f_1` to :math:`f_{55}` in the sequel.

.. The next section gives the
.. reasoning behind choosing exactly these 10 functions.

  

Function Groups
---------------------------------------------------------------

From combining the original ``bbob`` function classes, we obtain 15 function classes to structure the 55 bi-objective functions of the ``bbob-biobj`` testsuit. Each function class contains three or four functions. We are listing below the function classes and in parenthesis  the functions that belong to the respective class:
 1. separable - separable (functions :math:`f_1`, :math:`f_2`, :math:`f_{11}`)
 2. separable - moderate (:math:`f_3`, :math:`f_4`, :math:`f_{12}`, :math:`f_{13}`)
 3. separable - ill-conditioned (:math:`f_5`, :math:`f_6`, :math:`f_{14}`, :math:`f_{15}`)
 4. separable - multi-modal (:math:`f_7`, :math:`f_8`, :math:`f_{16}`, :math:`f_{17}`)
 5. separable - weakly-structured (:math:`f_9`, :math:`f_{10}`, :math:`f_{18}`, :math:`f_{19}`)
 6. moderate - moderate (:math:`f_{20}`, :math:`f_{21}`, :math:`f_{28}`)
 7. moderate - ill-conditioned (:math:`f_{22}`, :math:`f_{23}`, :math:`f_{29}`, :math:`f_{30}`)
 8. moderate - multi-modal (:math:`f_{24}`, :math:`f_{25}`, :math:`f_{31}`, :math:`f_{32}`)
 9. moderate - weakly-structured (:math:`f_{26}`, :math:`f_{27}`, :math:`f_{33}`, :math:`f_{34}`)
 10. ill-conditioned - ill-conditioned (:math:`f_{35}`, :math:`f_{36}`, :math:`f_{41}`)
 11. ill-conditioned - multi-modal (:math:`f_{37}`, :math:`f_{28}`, :math:`f_{42}`, :math:`f_{43}`)
 12. ill-conditioned - weakly-structured (:math:`f_{39}`, :math:`f_{40}`, :math:`f_{44}`, :math:`f_{45}`)
 13. multi-modal - multi-modal (:math:`f_{46}`, :math:`f_{47}`, :math:`f_{50}`)
 14. multi-modal - weakly structured (:math:`f_{48}`, :math:`f_{49}`, :math:`f_{51}`, :math:`f_{52}`)
 15. weakly structured - weakly structured (:math:`f_{53}`, :math:`f_{54}`, :math:`f_{55}`)


.. The original ``bbob`` function classes also allow to group the
.. 55 ``bbob-biobj`` functions, dependend on the
.. classes of the individual objective functions. Depending
.. on whether two functions of the same class are combined
.. or not, these resulting 15 new function classes contain three
.. or four functions:


More details about the single functions can be found in Section :ref:`sec-test-functions`. We however first describe their common properties in the coming sections.


Normalization, Ideal and Nadir Point
------------------------------------
None of the 55 ``bbob-biobj`` functions is explicitly normalized and the
optimization algorithms therefore have to cope with different scalings
in the two objective functions. Typically, different orders of magnitude
between the objective values can be observed.


However, to facilitate comparison between functions, a
normalization can take place as both the ideal and the nadir point are
known internally. In the performance assessment we are using this normalization (see `bbob-biobj-specific performance assessment documentation 
<http://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-biobj/perf-assessment/>`_ for
details).

.. Note that, for example, the ``bbob-biobj`` observer of
.. the `Coco framework`_ takes this into account and normalizes the objective
.. space, see the `bbob-biobj-specific performance assessment documentation 
.. <http://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-biobj/perf-assessment/>`_ for
.. details.

The reasons for having knowledge about the location of both the ideal and
the nadir point are

* the definitions of the single-objective ``bbob`` test functions for 
  which the optimal function value and the optimal solution are known
  by design and

* the fact that we explicitly chose only functions from the original
  ``bbob`` test suite which have a unique optimum.

The ideal point is then always given by the objective vector
:math:`(f_\alpha(x_{\text{opt},\alpha}), f_\beta(x_{\text{opt},\beta}))` and the nadir point by the
objective vector :math:`(f_\alpha(x_{\text{opt},\beta}), f_\beta(x_{\text{opt},\alpha}))`
with :math:`x_{\text{opt},\alpha}` being the optimal solution for the first
objective function :math:`f_\alpha` and :math:`x_{\text{opt},\beta}` being the
optimal solution for the second objective function :math:`f_\beta`.
Note that in the black-box case, we typically assume for the functions
provided with the `Coco framework`_, that information about ideal and
nadir points, scaling etc. is not provided to the algorithm.



Instances
---------
Our test functions are parametrized and instances are instantiations of the underlying parameters (see [COCO:2016]_). The instances for the bi-objective functions are using instances of each single objective function composing the bi-objective one. However, in addition, we assert that

  a. the distance (Euclidean norm) between the ideal and the nadir point (in objective space) is at least 1e-1 and that
  b. the two single-objective optima (in search space, also called the extreme optimal points) are not closer than :math:`10^{-4}`.

.. Instances are the way in the `Coco framework`_ to perform multiple
.. algorithm runs on the same function. More concretely, the original
.. Coco documentation states

.. ::

..   All functions can be instantiated in different *versions* (with
..   different location of the global optimum and different optimal
..  function value). Overall *Ntrial* runs are conducted on different
..  instantiations.

.. Also in the bi-objective case, we provide the idea of instances by
.. relying on the instances provided within the single-objective
.. ``bbob`` suite. 
.. However, in addition, we assert that

	 
We associate to an instance, an instance-id which is an integer. The relation between the instance-id, :math:`K^{\rm biobj}_{\rm id}`, of a bi-objective function and the instance-ids of the single-objective functions (:math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\alpha}` and :math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\beta}`) composing the bi-objective problem is the following:

 * :math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\alpha}` =  2 \* :math:`K^{\rm biobj}_{\rm id}` + 1 and
 * :math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\beta}` =  :math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\alpha}` + 1

If we find that conditions a. and b. above are not satisfied for all dimensions and functions in the ``bbob-biobj`` suite, we increase the instance-id of the second objective successfully until both properties are fulfilled. 
For example, the ``bbob-biobj`` instance-id
8 corresponds to the instance-id 17 for the first objective and instance-id 18 for
the second objective while for the ``bbob-biobj`` instance-id 9, the
first instance-id is 19 but for the second objective, instance-id 21 is chosen
instead of instance-id 20.

Exceptions to the above rule are, for historical reasons, the
``bbob-biobj`` instance-ids 1 and 2 in order to match the instance-ids
1 to 5 with the ones proposed in [BTH2015a]_. The ``bbob-biobj``
instance-id 1 contains the single-objective instance-ids 2 and 4 and
the ``bbob-biobj`` instance-id 2 contains the two instance-ids 3 and 5.

Note that the number of instances from the ``bbob-biobj`` suite is
neither limited from above nor from below. However, running some tests
with less than 3 instances will render the potential statistics and
their interpretation problematic while even the smallest difference can
be made statistically significant with a high enough number of
instances. Thus, we recommend to use between 5 to 15 instances for the actual
benchmarking.

Some Function Properties
------------------------
In the description of the 55 ``bbob-biobj`` functions below, several
general properties of objective functions will be mentioned that
shall be quickly defined here.

A *separable* function does not show any dependencies between the
variables and can therefore be solved by applying :math:`n` consecutive
one-dimensional optimizations along the coordinate axes while
keeping the other variables fixed. Consequently, *non-separable*
problems must be considered. They are much more difficult to solve. The
typical well-established technique to generate non-separable
functions from separable ones :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto g(x)` is the application of a rotation matrix
:math:`\mathbf R` to :math:`x`, that is :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto g(\mathbf R x)`.

A *unimodal* function has only one local minimum which is at the same
time also its global one. The opposite is a *multimodal* function
which appears to have at least one local minimum and which is
highly common in practical optimization problems.

*Ill-conditioning* is a another typical challenge in real-parameter
optimization and, besides multimodality, probably the most common one.
Conditioning of a function can be rigorously formalized in the
case of convex quadratic functions,
:math:`f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^THx` where :math:`H` is a symmetric
positive definite matrix, as the condition number of the Hessian matrix
:math:`H`. Since contour lines associated to a convex quadratic function
are ellipsoids, the condition number corresponds to the square root of
the ratio between the largest axis of the ellipsoid and the shortest axis.
For more general functions, conditioning loosely refers to the square of
the ratio between the largest and smallest direction of a contour line. 
The proposed ``bbob-biobj`` testbed contains ill-conditioned functions
with a typical conditioning of :math:`10^6`. We believe this a realistic
requirement, while we have seen practical problems with conditioning
as large as :math:`10^{10}`.




   

The 55 ``bbob-biobj`` Functions
-------------------------------

.. _f1:

:math:`f_1`: Sphere/Sphere
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of two sphere functions (:math:`f_1` in the ``bbob`` suite).

Both objectives are unimodal, highly symmetric, rotational and scale
invariant. The Pareto set is known to be a straight line and the Pareto 
front is convex. Considered as the simplest bi-objective problem in
continuous domain.

Contained in the *separable - separable* function class.

.. _f2:

:math:`f_2`: Sphere/Ellipsoid separable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of sphere function (:math:`f_1` in the ``bbob`` suite)
and separable ellipsoid function (:math:`f_2` in the ``bbob`` suite).

Both objectives are unimodal and separable. While the first objective is
truly convex-quadratic with a condition number of 1, the second
objective is only globally quadratic with smooth local
irregularities and highly ill-conditioned with a condition number of
about :math:`10^6`.

Contained in the *separable - separable* function class.

.. _f3:

:math:`f_3`: Sphere/Attractive sector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of sphere function (:math:`f_1` in the ``bbob`` suite)
and attractive sector function (:math:`f_6` in the ``bbob`` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, but only the first objective is
separable and truly convex quadratic. The attractive sector
function is highly asymmetric, where only one *hypercone* (with
angular base area) with a volume of roughly :math:`(1/2)^D`
yields low function values. The optimum of it is located at the tip
of this cone. This function can be deceptive for cumulative step
size adaptation.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function class.


.. rubric:: Information gained from this function:

* In comparison to :math:`f_1` and :math:`f_{20}`:  What is the
  effect of a highly asymmetric landscape in both or one

.. _f4:

:math:`f_4`: Sphere/Rosenbrock original
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of sphere function (:math:`f_1` in the ``bbob`` suite)
and original, i.e., unrotated Rosenbrock function (:math:`f_8` in the
``bbob`` suite).

The first objective is separable and truly convex, the second
objective is partially separable (tri-band structure). The first
objective is unimodal while the second objective has a local
optimum with an attraction volume of about 25\%.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function class.


.. rubric:: Information gained from this function:

* Can the search follow a long path with :math:`D-1` changes in
  the direction when it approaches one of the extremes of the
  Pareto front/Pareto set?





.. _f5:

:math:`f_5`: Sphere/Sharp ridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of sphere function (:math:`f_1` in the ``bbob`` suite)
and sharp ridge function (:math:`f_{13}` in the ``bbob`` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal.
In addition to the simple, separable, and differentiable first
objective, a sharp, i.e., non-differentiable ridge has to be
followed for optimizing the (non-separable) second objective. The
gradient towards the ridge remains constant, when the ridge is
approached from a given point.
Approaching the ridge is initially effective, but becomes ineffective
close to the ridge when the rigde needs to be followed in direction
to its optimum.  The necessary change in *search behavior* close to
the ridge is diffiult to diagnose, because the gradient
towards the ridge does not flatten out.

Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function class.

* Can the search continuously change its search direction when
  approaching one of the extremes of the Pareto front/Pareto set?
* What is the effect of having a non-smooth, non-differentiabale

.. _f6:

:math:`f_6`: Sphere/Sum of different powers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of sphere function (:math:`f_1` in the ``bbob`` suite)
and sum of different powers function (:math:`f_{14}` in the ``bbob``
suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal. The first objective is
separable, the second non-separable.
When approaching the second objective's optimum, the sensitivies
of the variables in the rotated search space become more and
more different. In addition, the second objective function
possesses a small solution volume.

.. _f7:

:math:`f_7`: Sphere/Rastrigin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of sphere function (:math:`f_1` in the ``bbob`` suite)
and Rastrigin function (:math:`f_{15}` in the ``bbob`` suite).

In addition to the simple sphere function, the prototypical highly
multimodal Rastrigin function needs to be solved which has originally
a very regular and symmetric structure for the placement of the optima.
Here, however, transformations are performed to alleviate
the original symmetry and regularity in the second objective.

The properties of the second objective contain non-separabilty,
multimodality (roughly :math:`10^D` local optima), a conditioning of
about 10, and a large global amplitude compared to the local amplitudes.

Contained in the *separable - multi-modal* function class.
